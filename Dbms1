purchase intersect select proid from sales);

f. Create a procedure which accepts a prodid and displays all the sales and 

purchase records of it.


Query: CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE disp(pID IN sales.Proid%type)

 2 IS

 3 CURSOR emp_cur is

 4 Select * from sales where Proid = pID;

 5 emp_rec emp_cur%rowtype;

 6 BEGIN

 7 FOR emp_rec in emp_cur

 8 LOOP
